# Scientific Calculator Java Swing App

This Java Swing application is a scientific calculator designed to perform various mathematical operations. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern for better organization and separation of concerns.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Mathematical Functions**: Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent), logarithmic functions (natural logarithm, base 10 logarithm), exponential function, square root, and more.
- **Memory Operations**: Store and recall values from memory.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle invalid inputs and mathematical errors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design with clear buttons and display.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Swing**: GUI toolkit for building graphical user interfaces in Java.
- **MVC Architecture**: Separates the application into three components: Model (business logic and data), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input and updates the model and view).
